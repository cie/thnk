# Thnk

Thnk is a command-line tool that automates the process of generating files based on AI models, similar to how Make automates the building of software. It uses a configuration file, akin to a Makefile, to manage dependencies and determine the operations required to generate target files from source files.

## Installation

To install Thnk, you need Node.js. Once Node.js is installed, you can install Thnk using npm:

```bash
npm install -g thnk
```

Ensure that you have set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to use the OpenAI models:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
```

Optionally, you can set the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable to specify the model to use. The default is `gpt-4o-mini`.

```bash
export OPENAI_MODEL='gpt-4o'
```

## Usage

To use Thnk, you need to create a `Thnkfile` in your project directory. This file defines the targets, dependencies, and the AI model configurations needed to generate your files.

Run Thnk in your terminal:

```bash
thnk
```

Thnk will read the `Thnkfile`, check for changes in dependencies, and regenerate the target files if necessary.

## Thnkfile Syntax

A `Thnkfile` consists of targets, dependencies, and recipes. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of its syntax:

- **Targets and Dependencies**: Each entry in the Thnkfile specifies a target file and its dependencies.

  ```
  target: dependency1 dependency2
  ```

- **Recipes**: The recipe is an indented block of text that's used as a prompt to generate the target file from the dependencies. Instead of providing the recipe in the Thnkfile, you include a `*.prompt.md` or `prompt.md` file among the dependencies.

  ```
  target: dependency1 dependency2
      Recipe to generate target from dependencies
  ```

  ```
  target: dependency1 dependency2 my.prompt.md
  ```

- **Schema files**: For `.json` targets, you can specify a `*.schema.json` or `schema.json` file containing a JSON schema, this will be used as a schema for the output JSON file.

  ```
  target.json: dependency1 dependency2 my.schema.json
    Generate a JSON file so that...
  ```

See the `examples` folder for sample `Thnkfile` configurations.

## Notes

- Thnk checks if the target files are up-to-date by comparing the modification times of the dependencies.
- If multiple `schema.json` or `prompt.md` files are specified, it's an error.
- Thnk supports integration with OpenAI's models, and you can specify the model in the environment variable `OPENAI_MODEL`.

Thnk simplifies the process of integrating AI-generated content into your projects, leveraging the familiar make-like syntax to manage complex dependencies and generation rules.
