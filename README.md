# Thnk

Thnk is a command-line tool that automates the process of generating files based on AI models, similar to how Make automates the building of software. It uses a configuration file, akin to a Makefile, to manage dependencies and determine the operations required to generate target files from source files.

### Version controlling prompts

Thnk also helps in version controlling of AI prompts with git, allowing you to track changes in your prompt files over time. By committing your prompts and the generated outputs, you can easily see how modifications to the prompts influence the generated text.

## Installation

To install Thnk, you need Node.js. Once Node.js is installed, you can install Thnk using npm:

```bash
npm install -g thnk
```

Ensure that you have set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to use the OpenAI models:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
```

Optionally, you can set the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable to specify the model to use. The default is `gpt-4o-mini`.

```bash
export OPENAI_MODEL='gpt-4o'
```

## Usage

To use Thnk, you need to create a `Thnkfile` in your project directory. This file defines the targets, dependencies, and the AI model configurations needed to generate your files.

Run Thnk in your terminal:

```bash
thnk
```

Thnk will read the `Thnkfile`, check for changes in dependencies, and regenerate the target files if necessary.

## Thnkfile Syntax

A `Thnkfile` consists of targets, dependencies, and recipes. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of its syntax:

- **Targets and Dependencies**: Each entry in the Thnkfile specifies a target file and its dependencies.

  ```
  target: dependency1 dependency2
  ```

- **Recipes**: The recipe is an indented block of text that's used as a prompt to generate the target file from the dependencies. Instead of providing the recipe in the Thnkfile, you include a `*.prompt.md` or `prompt.md` file among the dependencies.

  ```
  target: dependency1 dependency2
      Recipe to generate target from dependencies
  ```

  ```
  target: dependency1 dependency2 my.prompt.md
  ```

- **Schema files**: For `.json` targets, you can specify a `*.schema.json` or `schema.json` file containing a JSON schema, this will be used as a schema for the output JSON file.

  ```
  target.json: dependency1 dependency2 my.schema.json
    Generate a JSON file so that...
  ```

See the `examples` folder for sample `Thnkfile` configurations.

## Version Control with Git

Using Thnk in conjunction with git is highly beneficial for tracking the evolution of your AI prompts and their outputs. By committing both your prompt files and the generated text, you can leverage git's diff capabilities to observe how changes in the prompts affect the generated content. This practice not only aids in understanding the impact of your modifications but also enhances collaboration and reproducibility in projects that utilize AI-generated content.

## Notes

- Thnk checks if the target files are up-to-date by comparing the modification times of the dependencies.
- If multiple `schema.json` or `prompt.md` files are specified, it's an error.
- Thnk supports integration with OpenAI's models, and you can specify the model in the environment variable `OPENAI_MODEL`.

Thnk simplifies the process of integrating AI-generated content into your projects, leveraging the familiar make-like syntax to manage complex dependencies and generation rules.
