README.md : README.md

    Add a paragraph to README near the beginning to explain how Thnk can help in version
    controlling AI prompts with git. Also mention (maybe in a new section) how it's worth
    using Thnk together with git to see how changes in the prompts affect the generated
    text - you commit the generated text in version control, and you can easily see the
    changes in the generated text by looking at the diffs in git. This can be useful for
    tracking the effect of changes in the prompts.
