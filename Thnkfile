README.md : thnk.js Thnkfile
    Behave like the author of a good quality open-source software.
    Write the README, based on what you see in the source code.
    Thnk is like Make for AI text generation. Emphasize the similarity to Makefile
    - short introduction
    - installation
    - usage
    - Thnkfile syntax
    Be concise but helpful. Don't emphasize its benefits, don't be marketing-y. Make it as helpful
    as a good quality OSS README on GitHub.
