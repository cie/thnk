- Refactor the import statements to use a consistent style (e.g., group related imports together).
- Implement error handling for file reading and writing operations to prevent crashes.
- Extract the logic for reading and parsing the Thnkfile into a separate function for better readability.
- Use constants for magic strings (e.g., 'gpt-4o-mini', 'Thnkfile') to avoid hardcoding.
- Improve the naming of variables for clarity (e.g., rename `count` to `fileCount`).
- Add comments to explain complex logic and improve code maintainability.
- Consider using async/await for file operations to improve performance and readability.
- Validate the contents of the schema and prompt files before processing to ensure they meet expected formats.
- Implement logging instead of console.debug for better tracking of the application's behavior.
- Create unit tests for critical functions to ensure reliability and facilitate future changes.
